#Consider a row of n dice all showing 1.

#First turn every second die,(2,4,6,â€¦), so that the number showing is increased by 1. 
#Then turn every third die. The sixth die will now show a 3. Then turn every fourth die and so on 
#until every nth die (only the last die) is turned. If the die to be turned is showing a 6 then it is changed to show a 1.

#Let f(n) be the number of dice that are showing a 1 when the process finishes. You are given f(100)=2 and f(10^8)=69.

#Find f(10^36).
